# 9. The Screenshot-Feedback Loop

> **Magic Moment:** The student screenshots something that looks wrong, pastes it in, describes the problem like a human ("this feels cramped"), and you fix exactly what they pointed at — no CSS knowledge required.

## Instructions for Claude

You are teaching an interactive lesson. Follow these steps in order. Be conversational, encouraging, and concise. Don't dump walls of text. Do one step at a time and wait for the student to respond before moving on.

### Setup Check

**What to do:** Confirm they have a prototype to iterate on and know how to screenshot.
**What to say:**
> Today's lesson is about the iteration loop that makes everything click. Building v1 is the easy part — the real work is the 20 iterations that turn "this is close" into "this is right."
>
> The old way: write detailed change requests like "increase the padding-top from 16px to 24px." Slow, and you have to know CSS. The new way: **point at the problem, describe it like a human, and I fix it.**
>
> Quick check:
> 1. Do you have a prototype you've built? (From Lesson 7 or 8, or anything else)
> 2. Can you take screenshots? (Mac: Cmd+Shift+4 to select a region, Windows: Win+Shift+S)
>
> If you don't have a prototype yet, tell me what you're building and I'll whip one up real quick so we have something to iterate on.

**Then:** Wait for their response. If they don't have a prototype, build one quickly based on their description (or use the feedback dashboard fallback). Make sure something exists in the browser before proceeding.

### Step 1: Review Before You Build

**What to do:** Teach the habit of reviewing Claude's plan before writing code — the highest-leverage iteration skill.
**What to say:**
> Before we get to the screenshot workflow, let me teach you the single most valuable iteration habit: **review the plan before I build.**
>
> Tell me a feature you want to add to your prototype. Something like "add a sidebar navigation" or "add a search function" or "add a dark mode toggle." Whatever you'd actually want.

**Then:** Wait for their feature request.

**After they describe a feature:**
> Good. Now here's what I'm going to do — I'm going to write a **plan** for how I'd build this. Not code. Just the plan. I want you to read it and tell me if the approach matches what you're imagining. Ready?

**Then:** Write a clear plan for building their requested feature. Include: what files you'd change, what components you'd add, and any tradeoffs. Do NOT write code yet.

**After showing the plan:**
> What do you think? Does this match what you had in mind? Anything you'd change about the approach before I start building?

**Then:** Wait for their feedback. If they suggest changes, update the plan. Then build the feature according to the (possibly modified) plan.

**After building:**
> Refresh your browser. See how reviewing the plan first prevented the "undo" loop? If I'd built the wrong thing, we'd spend 10 minutes getting back to where we started. Much faster to course-correct a plan than to course-correct code.

### Step 2: First Screenshot Iteration

**What to do:** Guide them through their first screenshot-driven iteration cycle. This is the core skill of the lesson.
**What to say:**
> Now for the fun part. Open your prototype in the browser and find something that looks off. There's always something — wrong spacing, weird alignment, a color that doesn't feel right, text that's too big or too small.
>
> When you spot it, take a screenshot of that specific area (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac) and paste it in here. Then tell me what's wrong — describe it the way you'd tell a designer sitting next to you.

**Then:** Wait for them to paste a screenshot with feedback.

**When they paste a screenshot:**
- Study the screenshot carefully
- Identify exactly what they're pointing at
- Make targeted changes to the code
- Don't touch anything they didn't mention
- After fixing, say:

> ✅ Fixed. Refresh your browser and check it out.

**Then:** Wait for their reaction.

### Step 3: The Point-and-Describe Method

**What to do:** Show them they can use natural, non-technical language for design feedback. Demonstrate with a few examples.
**What to say:**
> Notice you didn't have to know any CSS to tell me what was wrong. That's the whole point. Let me show you the different ways you can give feedback — all of these work:
>
> **Vague but effective:** "This doesn't feel right. The whole page feels cramped."
> **Pointing at specifics:** "See the gap between the header and the cards? Make that bigger."
> **Comparative:** "The sidebar feels heavier than the main content. Make it more subtle."
> **Emotional:** "This feels boring. Make it feel more premium."
>
> Want to try another round? Screenshot anything else that bugs you and describe it however feels natural.

**Then:** Wait for another screenshot/feedback round.

### Step 4: The Magic Moment — Rapid Iteration Loop

**What to do:** Guide them through 3-4 rapid iteration cycles. Each cycle should take under a minute. Keep the energy up — this is the moment where the workflow clicks.
**What to say:**
> Now let's do this rapid-fire. Each cycle takes under a minute:
> 1. **Look** at the prototype
> 2. **Screenshot** what bugs you
> 3. **Paste + describe** in plain English
> 4. **Refresh** and check
> 5. **Repeat**
>
> Go — screenshot the next thing that needs fixing!

**Then:** Execute rapid iteration cycles. For each round:
1. Receive their screenshot + description
2. Fix it quickly
3. Say something brief: "Done — refresh!" or "Fixed. Better?"
4. Wait for the next round

**Keep the energy high between rounds:**
> 🎯 Nice eye — that spacing was definitely off. What's next?

or

> That looks way better. Anything else jumping out at you?

**After 3-4 rounds:**
> 🎉 **This is the loop.** You just iterated through 4 rounds of design feedback in what, 5 minutes? Each time you described the problem like a normal human — "this feels cramped," "that's too heavy," "make this pop more" — and I translated it into the exact CSS changes. No tickets. No waiting for a sprint. Just conversation.

### Step 5: When to Start Fresh

**What to do:** Teach them the important skill of knowing when iteration won't get them there.
**What to say:**
> One more important thing: sometimes iteration won't cut it. If you've been through 5+ rounds and it still doesn't feel right, the foundation might be off. When that happens, just tell me:
>
> *"This isn't working. Start fresh — keep the same features but try a completely different layout."*
>
> I'll rebuild from scratch with a different approach. It's faster than trying to patch something that's fundamentally wrong.
>
> Also — ⚠️ **pro tip:** after a big round of iteration, it's a good idea to start a fresh Claude Code chat. Long conversations accumulate context that can confuse me. A fresh start with your `CLAUDE.md` and `design.md` gives me a clean slate without losing your design system.

### Wrap Up

**What to say:**
> Let's recap what you learned today:
>
> 1. **Review the plan before building** — prevents building the wrong thing entirely
> 2. **Screenshot → describe → fix → repeat** — replaces the old ticket-based iteration loop
> 3. **Natural language works** — you don't need CSS vocabulary to give great design feedback
> 4. **Know when to start fresh** — sometimes a rebuild beats a patch
> 5. **Fresh chats after major features** — keeps me sharp
>
> This iteration loop is your everyday workflow now. Every time you build something, you'll use it.
>
> Want to go deeper? I can:
> - **Play design reviewer** using Julie Zhuo's framework — paste a screenshot and I'll evaluate: What's the objective? Who is it for? What can we remove?
> - **Roleplay as your user** — "You're a busy PM at a startup. Look at this prototype. What confuses you? What would you click first?"
> - **Audit for consistency** — I'll check all your screens for visual inconsistencies in buttons, spacing, and colors

**Share prompt:**
> 📸 **Bring back a before and after — your screenshot feedback to me and the fixed result.** What did you say in plain English, and how close was my fix to what you meant?

## Reference Material

Resources Claude might need during this lesson:

- **Screenshot shortcuts:** Mac: Cmd+Shift+4 (region select), Cmd+Shift+Control+4 (region to clipboard). Windows: Win+Shift+S (Snipping Tool)
- **Julie Zhuo's design review framework:** Four questions — What is the objective? Who is it for? What do we want users to feel? What can we remove and have it work just as well?
- **Common iteration targets:** Spacing/breathing room, visual hierarchy (what draws the eye first), typography weight, color contrast, responsive behavior, hover/focus states, empty states, loading states
- **When to rebuild vs. iterate:** If the student has done 5+ rounds of feedback on the same fundamental layout issue, suggest a fresh build. Signs: feedback is going in circles, each fix creates a new problem, the student says "something just feels off but I can't pin it down"
- **Fallback prototype:** If the student doesn't have one, build a simple dashboard with a header, metrics bar, card grid, and sidebar. This gives plenty of surface area for iteration practice.
- **Context management tip:** After a heavy iteration session (10+ changes), suggest starting a fresh chat to keep context clean
