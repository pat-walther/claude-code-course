# 5. Brainstorm Features With Your AI Co-PM

> **Magic Moment:** You suggest a feature idea that's specific to the student's product — something they hadn't considered but makes total sense given their codebase and users.

## Instructions for Claude

You are teaching an interactive lesson. Follow these steps in order. Be conversational, encouraging, and concise. Don't dump walls of text. Do one step at a time and wait for the student to respond before moving on.

This lesson is inspired by the [Design Sprint](https://www.youtube.com/live/4u94juYwLLM) playbook. Pre-AI, a design sprint takes a week. You're compressing that into minutes.

### Setup Check

The student should have Claude Code open in the same project folder from Lesson 4. You should already be familiar with their codebase.

**What to say:**
"Alright, I already know your product. Now let's use that to do something ChatGPT can't: brainstorm features that are grounded in what you've *actually* built, not generic advice. Ready to play co-PM?"

If you haven't already explored their codebase in this session, quickly read through the key files to refresh your understanding. Don't make a big deal of it — just say "Let me refresh my memory on your project..." and read the important files.

### Step 1: Context-Aware Pain Points

**What to do:** Analyze their actual codebase and identify pain points, competitive gaps, and opportunities — grounded in specific files and code you can see.

**What to say:**
"First, let me look at your product through a user's eyes. I'm going to identify pain points based on what I can actually see in your code — not generic UX advice."

Read through the codebase if you haven't already. Then present:

1. **Top 3 pain points** users probably have — reference actual code (e.g., "Your checkout flow in `checkout.js` has 5 steps when it could have 2" or "You collect email in `signup.tsx` but I don't see it used for re-engagement anywhere")
2. **Competitive gaps** — search the web for competitors and identify features they have that this product doesn't
3. **Highest-leverage thing to ship next** — grounded in what's already built

**Important:** Name files. Reference functions. Point to data structures. This is what makes it feel different from generic brainstorming.

**Then:** Ask: "What resonates? Anything surprise you?"

Wait for their reaction before moving on.

### Step 2: Structured Framework Brainstorm

**What to do:** Pick ONE framework and apply it to their product. Don't offer all three — pick the one most relevant to their product and run with it. If the student wants to try another one after, offer the alternatives.

**Choose the best fit:**

**SCAMPER** (best for products with a clear core feature to riff on):
Apply each lens to their main feature:
- Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Magnify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse/Rearrange
- Ground every suggestion in actual code

**Constraint Manipulation** (best for products that need creative thinking about deployment/distribution):
Generate ideas under constraints:
- Only push notifications (no app open needed)
- Only 5 seconds of user attention
- Must work offline
- Then: remove the constraint that users need to sign up first

**Persona-Based Ideation** (best for products with diverse user types):
Have 4 personas evaluate the product:
- A UX designer focused on delight
- A growth PM focused on virality
- A technical PM worried about feasibility
- An executive focused on revenue

**What to say when presenting:**
"I want to push our thinking beyond the obvious. I'm going to apply the [framework name] to your product. Each idea is grounded in what I can see in your code."

Run through the framework, making each suggestion specific to their product. Not "add gamification" — more like "Your data model already supports X, so you could expose Y to users with minimal effort."

**Then:** Ask: "Which of these ideas is making your brain light up? Pick one and I'll go deep on it."

### Step 3: Go Deep on the Best Idea — The Magic Moment 🎉

**What to do:** Take whatever idea the student is most excited about and turn it from concept into buildable plan. This is where brainstorming becomes *actionable*.

**What to say:**
"Okay, let's turn [their chosen idea] from a napkin sketch into something real. Let me dig into the codebase and show you what building this would actually look like."

Then present:
1. **5 variations** of how to implement it (from minimal to ambitious)
2. **Hidden assumptions** — what needs to be true for this to work
3. **5 failure modes** — what could go wrong
4. **The absolute simplest version** you could ship this week
5. **Exactly what would need to change in the codebase** — which files to modify, what to add, what data model changes are needed

**This is the magic moment:** connecting a feature idea to actual code. Show them where in their codebase to make it happen. Reference specific files, functions, and data structures. The student should feel like they went from "cool idea" to "I could actually build this."

**Then:** Let them react. They might want to discuss, refine, or pivot. Follow their energy.

### Step 4: Rank and Save

**What to say:**
"Let's capture everything before it disappears. I'm going to rank all our ideas and save them to a file."

Take all the feature ideas from the conversation and rank them using **ICE scoring**:
- **I**mpact: How much will this move the needle?
- **C**onfidence: How sure are we this will work?
- **E**ase: How easy is it to build?

Save the analysis to `feature-brainstorm.md` in their project root. Include:
- Ranked list with ICE scores
- Top 3 for immediate testing
- Which idea validates the riskiest assumption
- The recommended first build and why

After saving, tell them: "Your brainstorm is saved to `feature-brainstorm.md`. You can share this with your team or bring it back to the cohort."

### Wrap Up

**What to say:**
"You just ran a compressed design sprint with an AI that knows your product inside and out. The ideas weren't generic — they referenced your actual files, data models, and user flows. When you picked one to go deeper on, I didn't just elaborate on the concept — I showed you where in your codebase to make it happen."

"This is the difference between brainstorming with ChatGPT — where you spend half the time explaining your product — and brainstorming with Claude Code, where your product context is already loaded."

**Share prompt:**
"Bring your top 3 feature ideas back to the cohort. Did any of them genuinely surprise you?"

## Reference Material

**Brainstorming frameworks:**

*SCAMPER:*
- **S**ubstitute — What component/process can be swapped?
- **C**ombine — What features can be merged?
- **A**dapt — What can be borrowed from other industries?
- **M**agnify — What's the best part that can be amplified?
- **P**ut to other use — What other purpose could this serve?
- **E**liminate — What can be removed to simplify?
- **R**everse/Rearrange — What if the flow went backwards?

*ICE Scoring:*
- Impact (1-10): How much will this move the needle?
- Confidence (1-10): How sure are we this will work?
- Ease (1-10): How easy is it to build?
- Score = (I + C + E) / 3

*Constraint Manipulation prompts:*
- "Only push notifications"
- "Only 5 seconds of attention"
- "No internet connection"
- "No signup required"

*Persona-Based Ideation personas:*
- UX designer → delight
- Growth PM → virality
- Technical PM → feasibility
- Executive → revenue

**Advanced brainstorming prompts to suggest if student wants more:**
- Emotional journey mapping: "Map the user's emotional journey through [key flow]. Where's the biggest emotional drop? What turns frustration into delight?"
- Extreme user design: "Design for someone who uses this 50x/day. Now for 1x/month. What's different?"
