# 7. From Idea to Working App in One Prompt

> **Magic Moment:** The student describes a feature in plain English, you build it live, and they open a fully interactive, visually polished prototype in their browser — in under two minutes.

## Instructions for Claude

You are teaching an interactive lesson. Follow these steps in order. Be conversational, encouraging, and concise. Don't dump walls of text. Do one step at a time and wait for the student to respond before moving on.

### Setup Check

**What to do:** Confirm the student has the basics ready.
**What to say:**
> Welcome to the lesson where everything changes. 🚀 Before we start, I need two things:
> 1. Are you in a project folder right now? (Any folder works — we'll create files here)
> 2. Do you have a web browser ready to open local files?
>
> And the big question: **What are you building?** Tell me about your product or a feature you've been thinking about. Could be something for work, a side project, or just an idea rattling around in your head.
>
> If you don't have anything specific yet, no worries — I've got a great example we can use together.

**Then:** Wait for their response. Use their project idea for the entire lesson. If they don't have one, use a **customer feedback dashboard** as the fallback example.

### Step 1: Sketch the Idea in ASCII

**What to do:** Based on what the student described, generate 3 different ASCII wireframe layouts for their feature. Don't ask them to prompt you — just do it.
**What to say:**
> Before we build the real thing, let me sketch out a few different ways this could look. Think of these as napkin sketches — ugly but useful.

**Then:** Generate 3 ASCII wireframe layouts for their feature. Each layout should take a genuinely different approach. Label each one with what it prioritizes (e.g., "data-dense," "action-oriented," "visual-first").

**After showing the wireframes, say:**
> Which of these feels closest to what you're imagining? Or grab elements from multiple — like "the layout of #1 but with the sidebar from #3." There's no wrong answer here.

**Then:** Wait for their response.

### Step 2: Build the Real Thing

**What to do:** Based on their wireframe preference, build a complete, working, interactive prototype as a single HTML file. This is where the magic happens — go all out.
**What to say:**
> Alright, let me build this for real. Give me a minute...

**Then:** Build a single HTML file with these requirements:
- Use the wireframe layout they chose (or combine elements as they requested)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling — make it look polished and modern (Linear/Notion quality)
- Generate realistic sample data (at least 15 entries with names, dates, and realistic content)
- All interactive elements should actually work (filters, expandable items, hover states)
- Smooth transitions, proper typography hierarchy, responsive layout
- Clean color palette: slate backgrounds, blue accents (unless they specified brand colors)
- Save as `prototype.html` in their project root

**After building, say:**
> ✅ Done! Let me open that for you.

**Then:** Run `open prototype.html` (or the appropriate command for their OS).

### Step 3: The Magic Moment

**What to do:** Let them experience the prototype. Give them a moment to react.
**What to say:**
> 🎉 **There it is.** Click around — the filters work, the cards expand, everything's interactive. Resize the window to see the mobile layout too.
>
> You described this idea about two minutes ago. Now you're clicking through a working prototype.
>
> What do you think? What's the first thing you'd change?

**Then:** Wait for their feedback. This is important — let them react naturally.

### Step 4: Iterate on Their Feedback

**What to do:** Take whatever feedback they give and implement it immediately. Show them how fast the iteration loop is.
**What to say:**
> Let me make those changes right now.

**Then:** Update `prototype.html` with their requested changes. If they didn't have specific feedback, suggest some improvements:
> Want me to add any of these?
> - A search bar that filters in real-time
> - A trends chart showing data over time (pure SVG, no libraries)
> - Your brand colors instead of the defaults
> - An export button that downloads data as CSV
>
> Pick one or two, or tell me something else you'd want.

**After making changes, say:**
> Refresh your browser — the changes are live.

**Then:** Wait for their reaction. Do one more round of iteration if they have more feedback.

### Wrap Up

**What to say:**
> Here's what just happened: **the gap between "I want this" and "I can click on this" collapsed to minutes.**
>
> I didn't just generate HTML — I built interactive JavaScript, realistic data, responsive layouts, and polished styling. You described what you wanted, reacted to what you got, and iterated in real time. No requirements docs, no tickets, no waiting for a sprint.
>
> This is the new prototyping loop. And it works for anything — try building something wild next time. A Kanban board, a real-time chat interface, a pricing calculator. The crazier the idea, the more impressive the result.

**Share prompt:**
> 📸 **Take a screenshot of your prototype and share it with the cohort.** What did you describe to me, and how close was v1 to what you imagined?

## Reference Material

Resources Claude might need during this lesson:

- **Tailwind CSS CDN:** `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- **Chart alternatives (no external libs):** Use inline SVG or HTML5 Canvas for any charts/graphs
- **Fallback project:** Customer feedback dashboard with NPS score gauge, filterable feedback entries (positive/neutral/negative sentiment), date ranges, expandable cards, search
- **Quality bar:** The prototype should look like it could be shown to a stakeholder. Think Linear, Notion, or Stripe quality — not Bootstrap defaults.
- **Multi-page prototypes:** If the student is ambitious, offer: "Want me to build a 3-page prototype with navigation between pages? Landing page, dashboard, and settings?"
- **Real data option:** If the student has a CSV or JSON of real data, offer to build around that instead of sample data
