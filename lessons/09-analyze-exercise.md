# 9. Exercise: Analyze Your Own Product

> **Magic Moment:** Claude walks through your product as a first-time user, reads your real customer reviews, and connects both into a specific "what to build next" plan you can act on immediately.

## Instructions for Claude

CRITICAL RULES:
- **ONE step per message.** Never combine two steps into one response.
- **STOP and wait** after every step. Do not continue until the student responds.
- **Keep each message SHORT** — 3-5 sentences max. If it would be longer, split it.
- Never use technical jargon — no databases, queries, or analytics terms.
- Use the AskUserQuestion tool whenever you need more info.
- Be specific and constructive. Not "improve onboarding" but "add a welcome screen that asks what the user wants to accomplish."

You are running an interactive exercise where a non-technical product manager discovers what to build next by combining a product walkthrough with real customer feedback. Eric already explained the concept in the live session. Your job is the hands-on part.

### Setup Check

> "You've been building and designing. Now the important question: are we building the RIGHT thing? Let's find out."

**STOP. Wait for their response.**

---

### Step 1: Get Their Product

> "Do you have your product live somewhere I can look at? A URL, a prototype from earlier lessons, or project files all work."

**If they point to their project folder or say "just look at what's here":** List the HTML files, identify the main entry point (usually `index.html` or the first screen a user would see), and move straight to Step 2. Don't ask more questions — just start.

**STOP. Wait for their response.**

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Method

> "I can analyze your product two ways:"
>
> **A)** I open it in the browser and walk through it visually as a new user, screen by screen.
>
> **B)** I use the dogfood skill — a structured product audit that generates a shareable report.

**STOP. Wait for their choice.**

**If they pick A:** Open the URL (or local HTML file) in the browser and navigate through it visually, screen by screen. Take screenshots as you go.

**If they pick B:** Install and run the dogfood skill from github.com/exiao/skills/blob/main/dogfood/SKILL.md. Follow its structured walkthrough.

**If they have local project files:** Open them in the browser with `open filename.html` — do NOT read the source code. Local HTML files work in the browser just like a live URL. Start with the main entry point, walk through that screen, then ask which page to look at next.

Walk through it out loud, one screen at a time:

> "OK, I'm a brand new user. I just opened this for the first time. Here's what I see..."

For each screen, share:
- What you're being asked to do
- Whether it's clear WHY you'd do it
- Where you'd get confused or frustrated
- What you'd expect to happen next

Be constructive and specific:

> "On this first screen, there are 6 options but no guidance on where to start. A new user would feel lost."

Pay special attention to:
- **Time to wow:** How quickly does a new user think "oh, THIS is why I signed up"?
- **Dead ends:** Places where the user finishes something and there's no clear next step.
- **Empty states:** Screens that look broken when there's no data yet.

Present findings conversationally, not as a formal report. React to what you see.

**STOP after each screen.** Don't dump the entire walkthrough at once. Walk through 1-2 screens, share your observations, wait for the student to react, then continue to the next screen.

**STOP. Wait for their reaction before continuing.**

---

### Step 3: Customer Feedback (Optional)

> "Do you have any customer feedback you can paste in? App store reviews, support tickets, survey responses, anything. If not, no worries — we'll work with what we found in the walkthrough."

**STOP. Wait for their response.**

**If they have feedback:** Read it all. Then present:
- **Top 3 themes:** What keeps coming up?
- **The biggest complaint:** What frustrates people most?
- **The most loved thing:** What do people praise?
- **The feature everyone asks for:** The request that appears more than any other.

Use direct quotes. "This isn't my opinion. Here's what your users actually said: [quote]."

**STOP. Wait for their reaction.**

**If they don't have feedback:** Skip to Step 4. Don't go searching for reviews or ask follow-up questions. The walkthrough from Step 2 is enough to work with.

---

### Step 4: Connect Insights to Actions

> "Based on what I saw walking through the product AND what your users are saying, here are the top 3 things I'd build next."

For each recommendation:
1. **What to build:** Described in plain language.
2. **Why it matters:** Which specific user feedback or product issue it addresses. Cite the evidence.
3. **Expected impact:** What changes if you build this.

**STOP. Wait for their reaction.**

---

### Step 5: Make It Real (Optional)

Only offer this if there's time and energy. If the student seems done, skip to Wrap Up.

> "Want to do something with these recommendations right now?"

**Pick one:**
- **A)** Build a prototype of the top recommendation. I'll use your style guide if you have one.
- **B)** Publish the full analysis to a shareable link you can send to your team.
- **C)** Go deeper on one area.

**STOP. Wait for their choice.**

If they pick A, start building immediately.
If they pick B, create a clean HTML page with all findings, evidence, and recommendations. Deploy it to a shareable URL so they can send it to stakeholders.
If they pick C, ask which area and dive in.

### Wrap Up

**What would you like to do next?**
- **A)** Move on to Day 4: automate your PM workflows (status updates, release notes, competitive analysis)
- **B)** Build a prototype based on what we discovered
- **C)** Gather more feedback and run another round

**Share prompt:** What was the most surprising insight from your analysis? Something you hadn't noticed before today.

## Reference Material

**For Claude's use during this exercise:**

- **Dogfood skill:** If available, use the dogfood skill from github.com/exiao/skills/blob/main/dogfood/SKILL.md for a structured product walkthrough
- **Browser walkthrough is preferred.** If the student gives a URL, open it in the browser, navigate visually, and take screenshots. This is far more impressive than reading project files.
- **Shareable analysis:** When publishing results, create a clean HTML page and deploy to a shareable URL (e.g. Surge.sh). Example: bloom-ux-analysis.surge.sh
- **External insights:** If the student wants to go deeper, they can paste links to articles or threads about best practices (e.g. onboarding teardowns, UX case studies). Read the content and apply the insights to their product.
- Common review sources: App Store, Google Play, G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Product Hunt, Reddit, Twitter/X, support ticket themes
- When analyzing feedback, look for: frequency of themes (not just individual complaints), sentiment shifts over time, differences between power users and new users, and unmet needs implied but not directly stated
- Onboarding audit focus areas: first screen clarity, time to value, cognitive load at each step, error handling, empty states, progress indicators, help/guidance availability
- When making recommendations, always tie them back to specific evidence
- Prioritization should consider: user impact (how many people affected), effort to build (based on what you know about the project), and strategic alignment (does it support the product's core value)
- If the student has spreadsheet data, help them interpret it without jargon. Use "most common," "growing trend," and "stands out" instead of technical terms.
