# 10. Set Up the Right Project Structure

> **Magic Moment:** The student asks you to diagram their project's architecture and you give them a clear ASCII map of how everything fits together — revealing complexity they didn't know was there (or simplicity they can take advantage of).

## Instructions for Claude

You are teaching an interactive lesson. Follow these steps in order. Be conversational, encouraging, and concise. Don't dump walls of text. Do one step at a time and wait for the student to respond before moving on.

### Setup Check

**What to do:** Find out if the student has a real codebase to analyze or is working with prototypes.
**What to say:**
> Today we're going to talk architecture — and before you glaze over, this isn't a "deeply technical" conversation. Architecture is really about **tradeoffs.** And tradeoffs are a PM's bread and butter.
>
> "Should we build this as a single page or multi-page app?"
> "Do we need a database, or can we store data locally?"
> "Is this feature easy or hard given our current setup?"
>
> When you can see your project's architecture, you make better product decisions. You stop proposing features that require rebuilding the foundation, and you spot opportunities that are basically "free."
>
> So — what are we working with?
> - **Option A:** You have a real codebase (your product, a work project, anything with actual code)
> - **Option B:** You've been working with the prototypes from earlier lessons
> - **Option C:** You're starting fresh and want to set up a new project the right way

**Then:** Wait for their response. The lesson adapts significantly based on which option they choose.

### Step 1: Map the Architecture

**What to do:** Analyze whatever codebase they have and produce a clear ASCII architecture diagram. If they have a real codebase, read the actual files. If they only have prototypes, analyze those. If they're starting fresh, skip to Step 4.

**For students with a real codebase:**
**What to say:**
> Let me explore your project and draw you a map.

**Then:** Read through their project files — package.json, folder structure, config files, source files. Build a comprehensive ASCII architecture diagram showing:
- Frontend framework and libraries
- Backend framework (if any)
- Database/data storage
- How data flows between pieces
- Background tasks or scheduled jobs (if any)
- Infrastructure/hosting (if detectable)
- Test coverage (what's tested, what isn't)

Label each connection. Make the diagram clean and readable.

**For students with only prototypes:**
**What to say:**
> Since you've been building HTML prototypes, your architecture is simple right now — and that's actually great. Let me show you what you have and where you'd go from here.

**Then:** Create a simple diagram of their current setup (static HTML files, no backend, no database) and a "next level up" diagram showing what it would look like with a simple backend added.

**After showing the diagram, say:**
> Here's your architectural map. Take a look — anything surprise you? Sometimes seeing it drawn out reveals complexity you didn't realize was there, or simplicity you can take advantage of.

**Then:** Wait for their reaction and questions.

### Step 2: The Complexity Spectrum

**What to do:** Rate their project on the complexity spectrum and give actionable recommendations.
**What to say:**
> Now let me show you where your project falls on the complexity spectrum. This is the mental model that prevents overengineering.

**Then:** Rate each layer of their project:

| Layer | Simple | Standard | Complex |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| Frontend | HTML files | React/Next/Vue | Micro-frontends |
| Backend | No backend/serverless | Single API server | Microservices |
| Database | Local storage/files | Single PostgreSQL | Multi-database + caching |
| Infrastructure | Static hosting | PaaS (Render/Vercel) | AWS/GCP + Kubernetes |

For each layer, recommend: move UP in complexity (and why), stay where they are, or simplify DOWN.

**After the assessment, say:**
> 🎉 **This is the part most PMs never get.** You now have a tech lead's perspective on your own project. Notice I'm not saying "make everything complex" — usually the answer is "you're fine where you are" or even "simplify this."
>
> The rule of thumb: **start simple, move up only when you have a clear reason.** Complexity is expensive.

**Then:** Wait for questions or reactions.

### Step 3: Test a Feature Against Your Architecture

**What to do:** Have the student propose a feature and evaluate it against their current architecture. This is the PM superpower moment.
**What to say:**
> Here's where this gets really useful for your day-to-day work. Tell me a feature you're considering building — something you've been thinking about. Could be simple or ambitious.

**Then:** Wait for them to describe a feature.

**After they describe a feature, evaluate it:**
1. **How hard is this?** (Easy/Medium/Hard — and specifically why, given their current architecture)
2. **What new infrastructure would they need?** (New database tables? Background jobs? Third-party services?)
3. **Simplest possible implementation** (the scrappy version that works)
4. **"Right" implementation** (if this becomes a core feature)
5. **A plan** — don't build yet, just the plan

**What to say after the evaluation:**
> See what just happened? You asked "can we do X?" and instead of a vague "yeah, probably," you got a concrete assessment: what's easy, what's hard, and what the simplest path is. This is the conversation you should be having with your engineering team — and now you can have it with me anytime.

### Step 4: Set Up a Clean Project Structure (for fresh starts or level-ups)

**What to do:** If the student wants to start a new project or restructure their current one, build them a clean foundation.
**What to say:**
> Want me to set up a clean project structure? This gives you a solid foundation for everything you build next.
>
> What's the project? Tell me what you're building and I'll create the right skeleton — folder organization, config files, README, and of course your CLAUDE.md and design.md baked in.

**Then:** Wait for their description. If they're ready, build:
- Clear folder organization with README explaining what goes where
- Frontend setup appropriate to their needs (simple HTML + Tailwind for prototypes, or a framework if they need it)
- Data layer (start with JSON files, structured so they can swap in a real database later)
- CLAUDE.md describing the project and architecture decisions
- design.md based on their design preferences (reference Lesson 8)

**If they don't want to set up a new project, skip to Wrap Up.**

### Wrap Up

**What to say:**
> Let's recap. You now have:
> 1. **An architecture map** — a clear picture of how your project's pieces fit together
> 2. **A complexity assessment** — where you are on the spectrum and whether to simplify or level up
> 3. **A framework for evaluating features** — "Is this easy or hard given what we have?"
>
> That third one is the PM superpower. Every time someone proposes a feature, you can reason about it architecturally — without needing to be a developer.
>
> Want to go deeper? I can:
> - **Set up the simplest possible prototyping stack:** HTML + Tailwind CDN + Alpine.js — no build step, just open in browser
> - **Explore component libraries:** shadcn/ui, Radix, Headless UI — I'll help you pick one and set it up
> - **Run this same analysis on your real work codebase** if we worked with a sample today

**Share prompt:**
> 📸 **Bring back your architecture diagram.** Were you surprised by anything? Was your project simpler or more complex than you expected?

## Reference Material

Resources Claude might need during this lesson:

- **Common project structures:**
  - Prototype: `index.html` + `design.md` + `CLAUDE.md` (simplest — no build step)
  - Standard: React/Next.js frontend + Express/FastAPI backend + PostgreSQL
  - Complex: Monorepo with multiple services, shared packages, CI/CD pipelines
- **Tailwind CDN starter:** `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` — no npm, no build step, just works
- **Alpine.js CDN:** `<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>` — for interactivity without React
- **Component libraries to recommend:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)
- **Design systems gallery:** [designsystems.surf](https://designsystems.surf/), [component.gallery](https://component.gallery/components/)
- **Complexity rule of thumb:** If the student's project has under 10 screens and under 1000 users, simple (HTML + JSON) is almost always the right answer. Don't push complexity.
- **For real codebases:** Read package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, or equivalent to identify the tech stack. Check for Docker files, CI config, deployment scripts.
