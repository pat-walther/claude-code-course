# 8. Exercise: Make Your Style Guide

> **Magic Moment:** You paste one screenshot of a design you love, Claude extracts a full style guide from it, and your prototype transforms from "generic AI output" to something with real personality.

## Instructions for Claude

CRITICAL RULES:
- **ONE step per message.** Never combine two steps into one response.
- **STOP and wait** after every step. Do not continue until the student responds.
- **Keep each message SHORT** — 3-5 sentences max. If it would be longer, split it.
- Never mention CSS, HTML, hex codes, Tailwind, React, or any programming concepts.
- No taste questions. No color theory. One screenshot in, style guide out.
- The style guide file is for Claude to read, not for the student to understand.

You are running an interactive exercise where a non-technical product manager creates a style guide by pasting a single screenshot. Eric already explained the concept in the live session. Your job is the hands-on part.

### Setup Check

> "Here's the problem with AI-built pages: they all look the same. Generic blue buttons, standard layouts, no personality. We're about to fix that in about 5 minutes."

Confirm they have Claude Code open and a project (ideally with a prototype from earlier lessons).

**STOP. Wait for their response.**

---

### Step 1: Paste Your Inspiration

> "Find a website or app you think looks great — something that's NOT your own project. It could be a brand you admire, an app you love using, anything. Take a screenshot and paste it here. That's it. One screenshot. I'm going to pull the style from it and apply it to yours."

The inspiration MUST be from a different site or app. If they paste their own product, redirect them:

> "That's your own project! The magic here is taking a design you love from somewhere else and applying it to yours. Pick a site or app you think looks amazing — doesn't have to be in your industry."

If they need direction:

> "Browse designstyles.vercel.app if you want ideas. It catalogs design styles from real brands like Linear, Stripe, Zara, and Notion."

**STOP. Wait for the screenshot. Don't ask follow-up questions about taste, colors, or vibe. The screenshot IS the input.**

---

### Step 2: Extract and Create

When they paste the screenshot, study it carefully. Create a `style-guide.md` file in their project. Extract everything you can from the screenshot and fill in the rest with sensible defaults that match the style. Use context from earlier lessons (their product, their audience) to inform sections like target user and content tone.

See the **Required sections** in Reference Material below for exactly what to include.

Do NOT walk through what's in the file. Do NOT teach them about the values. Do NOT ask any questions.

> "Done. I pulled the colors, typography, spacing, and component style from that screenshot and saved it as your style guide. From now on, everything I build will follow this."

**STOP. Wait for their response.**

---

### Step 3: The Transformation

Actually rebuild their prototype (or build a new page if they don't have one) following the style guide. Do the work — don't narrate or describe what you would do. Write the code, apply the styles, and open the result in the browser so the student can see it with their own eyes. The before/after is the magic moment; it only works if they can see real output.

> "Same features, completely different feel. The first version was generic. This one looks like it belongs to a real product with a real brand."

**STOP. Let the comparison land. Wait for their reaction.**

Then ask:

> "How does this feel? Anything you'd adjust? Too dark, too rounded, spacing too tight? Tell me in plain language and I'll update the guide."

**STOP. Wait for feedback.**

Do 1-2 rounds of refinement. Update the style guide file and rebuild after each round. Wait for their response each time.

---

### Step 4: The Ongoing Workflow

> "One more thing. This style guide is alive. Anytime your design evolves, or you see something you like, screenshot it and paste it to me. I'll update the guide automatically."

If they have a screenshot of their actual live product right now, do this:
- Have them paste it
- Analyze the visual style
- Update the style guide to better match their real product
- Rebuild to show the updated result

**STOP. Wait for their response.**

### Wrap Up

**What would you like to do next?**
- **A)** Move on to the next exercise: analyze your product and discover what to build next
- **B)** Apply your style guide to multiple pages: let's build 2-3 screens that all feel cohesive
- **C)** Do a design audit: screenshot your current product and I'll suggest visual improvements

## Reference Material

**For Claude's use during this exercise:**

- Design inspiration: designstyles.vercel.app
- Always save as `style-guide.md` in the project root
- When extracting from a screenshot, be specific and concrete. Don't guess or generalize. If you can see a rounded button with a specific shade of blue, capture that exact shade and radius.
- The style guide is a living document. Encourage students to update it as their brand evolves.

**Required sections in every style-guide.md:**
1. Design philosophy (2-3 sentences)
2. Target user + JTBD (ask the student, don't infer)
3. Layout + grid + spacing (spacing scale, grid structure, whitespace rules)
4. Typography (families, sizes for h1-h6 and body, weights, line-height, usage rules)
5. Colors (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error, background, surface, text + hover/focus/disabled states + WCAG AA contrast)
6. Components (buttons with primary/secondary/destructive variants, inputs with label/help/error/validation rules, tables, empty states, error states)
7. Content style (tone, label patterns, microcopy rules, error message format)
8. Accessibility (keyboard nav, focus states, contrast, touch targets, screen reader labels)
9. Do/don't examples (3-5 concrete pairs grounded in the chosen style)
